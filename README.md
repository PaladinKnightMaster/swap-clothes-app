### Design

- #### Color scheme
    - I wanted to create a fun/colorful but clean and simple (looking not coding) look to the site. I aimed to make swapping clothes and contributing to sustainable living - interesting and interactive. The inspiration for the colors came from [uiGradidents](https://uigradients.com/#SweetMorning) website, 'Sweet Morning' gradient. Colors used for this gradient and also as my accent colors are 'Fiery Rose' (#FF5F6D) and 'Mellow Apricot' (#FFC371). The primary accent color was 'Fiery Rose' as it provides more contrast against the white background - which is the dominant color of the website. The text color chosen was 'Davys Gray' (#585858) to create a softer look as opposed to opting to use black text, while still maintaining comfortable contrast between the background and the text. Finally, I used black as the main color for the Landing page to create an impactful first impression when a user first visits the site. The color palette was assembled using [coolors](https://coolors.co/ffc371-ff5f6d-ffffff-585858-000000) color palette generator.

        <img src="./static/graphics/readme/gradient.png" height="100px" />
        <img src="./static/graphics/readme/color-palette.png" height="50px" />

- #### Typography
    - The font used for this website is a sans serif type font 'Montserrat' with Sand Serif as a fallback font. I chose this font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=Mont&preview.text=SWAP%20your%20clothes&preview.text_type=custom) website with the main aim to keep the text clean, clear, and easily readable. Since the website contains colorful accents and gradients, I opted to use only one font for the whole website with changing font weight and font style instead. 

        <img src="./static/graphics/readme/font-montserrat.png" height="50px" />


    - [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons were used across pages to emphasize the meaning of the text it was placed alongside, allow the user to understand content faster, and add to the fun look of the site. 

- #### Imagery
    - Images
        - The primary reason for using images is for informative purposes. Images are displayed in item cards to allow users to visually engage with items added by other users and decide if they are interested in the item.
        - The secondary purpose of the images is aesthetic. The images displayed on cards are kept quite large and the same size while not being distorted. This attributes to the clean, organized look of the website. An image is also used as a hero image that takes the full screen to separate the page and not distract the user from the message on the landing page.
        - All images have been taken from [unspalsh](https://unsplash.com/) and minified using [tinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.co)

    - Graphics
        - Graphics are used for aesthetic and design purposes only. The legs on the landing page set the tone for the website and the colors tie in with the header gradient to create a sense of uniformity.
        - Graphics used were designed by [Pablo Stanley from Hhmaaans](https://www.humaaans.com/) and [Katerina Limpitsouni from unDraw](https://undraw.co/)

- #### Other 
    - Technology
        - [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) front-end framework to implement responsive design and features.
        - [Swseetalert](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) to display confirmation pop-up for deleting or flaggin items. 
        - [slick carousel](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) to contain items on the 'My Profile' page. I opted to use this as opposed to materialize carousel due to ease of implementation as Materialize carousel uses IDs as triggers which are not ideal as the data was rendered by looping through the database.
    - Shadows
        - Instead of creating borders around items and sections, shadows were used instead. It creates a 3D effect and an illusion of a clean, non-restricted space.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Common Features Across Pages
- [x] **Header** - facilitates an effortless navigation across all pages
    - The header is positioned to always be visible at the top of the screen (mobile, tablet, and desktop) which allows visitors to find it quickly.
    - The brand logo is positioned at the top of the page in the header and redirects the user back to the home page. This allows the user to easily find the homepage.
    - The page navigation is located in the header at the top of the page on desktop and laptop sizes and a side navigation component on mobile and tablet sizes. This adheres to the navigation conventions allowing the user to intuitively navigate the page.
    - Navigation links expand and are underlined when hovered over on larger screen sizes, letting the user know that these are clickable links.
    - The navigation link, matching the page that the user is visiting, stays 'active'(which matches the hover effect from the previous point) to let the user quickly establish which page she/he is visiting.
    - Navigation links collapse in a personalized hamburger menu when viewed in mobile sizes.
- [x] **Heading**
    - All headings are styled in the same manner to let the user understand the page structure quickly.
- [x] **Links/buttons**
    - All links have a hover effect and are noticeably different than the rest of the text around them, indicating that they are clickable.
    - All external links open in a new tab to allow the user to easily navigate back to the page.
    - Buttons increase in size and have a shadow effect applied when hovered over.
- [x] **Footer**
    - Footer is always displayed at the bottom of the page, regardless of the content size.
    - 'Go to the top' link included allowing the user to easily navigate to the top which is particularly important on mobile screen sizes.
    - Socials are displayed and grouped. They are displayed in the footer to adhere to the convention and let the user locate them quickly.
- [x] **Card Items** - display clothing items added by users
    - All cards are the same size regardless of the content amount. This is achieved by limiting characters allowed when an item is added. This provides consistency and creates predictability of how the page will look.
    - Images take the most of the space and are fitted to be contained within a space without being distorted. This creates a visually appealing and not text-heavy site and keeps the user interested to look through items.
    - Each item has a heading and a short description is shown with an option to get more detailed information once clicked on.
    - Item creator and their image is displayed in the card footer. If the user has matched with the creator of the item, the username can be clicked on and reveals the creator's social media icons.
    - Delete and edit icons are displayed in the card footer to the creator of the item.
    - Flag item is displayed in the c rd footer allowing users to flag inappropriate content and only the admin to unflag it.
    - Floating 'like' button is displayed at the bottom of the image. It has 3 different instances - disabled to the creator of the item, empty heart on unliked items, and filled heart on liked items.
    - Confirmation for deleting and flagging items is displayed using [sweetalert](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) which pops-up and provides feedback after confirmation.
- [x] **Responsivensess**
    - All Pages are responsive and provide the same functionality regardless of the viewport size.
- [x] **Accessibility**
    - There are no flashing images or sounds to hinder the user experience.
- [x] **Flash messages**
    - Messages displayed at the top of the page to provide the user with feedback when the user logs-out, registers, etc.



### Specific to Pages
- [x] **Home** Page
    - Short introduction to let the user know what the page is.
    - 'Get Started' button that navigates an unauthorized user to the 'Register' page. This allows users to find the Register page easily and a user will more likely create an account. If a user is logged in and navigates to the 'Home' page, the 'Get Started'  button will redirect them to the 'Items' page.
    - A helper icon displayed under the call-to-action button that triggers the 'About' modal which has more detailed information about how the site works. This further provides clarity of the meaning of the website.
    - Hot Items section displays the 3 most liked items which might be a factor in deciding to create an account.
- [x] **Items** Page
    - Category filter allows users to filter all items by categories that allow users to view items that they are interested in. Furthermore, the displayed categories have been formatted to let the user know what they have selected. User can clear all filters to display all items
    - Sort functionality allows an unauthorized user to sort items by the most recently added, alphabetical order, and reverse alphabetical order. Authorized users and admin have additional functionality to sort items by their liked items and flagged items.
    - Search functionality allows the user to search for items using specific words or phrases. The items are searched by using their headings and short descriptions.
    - Pagination allows the page not to get overcrowded and display only 9 items at a time. The total number of items is displayed alongside the page number to let the user know how many items there are altogether.
- [x] **My Profile** Page
    - Top component displays user information letting the user know what details they have entered.
    - Edit Profile button allows the user to edit their profile
    - Responsive carousels containing Added items, matched items, and suggested items. This allows the page not to get too overcrowded while still having a good overview of all sections. It scales down depending on the screen size. The carousel items have arrow buttons to facilitate site navigation, icons at the bottom indicating how many slides there are and additionally, the slides can be dragged and swiped.
- [x] **Register, Log In, Add Item** Pages
    - Responsive forms to allow users to easily fill them out on all screen sizes. 
    - Forms provide validation if an input field is required and provides the user with real-time feedback if the value entered is valid. This lets the user save time by fixing the input field before submitting the form if relevant.


### Future Features
- [ ] Add the' Events' section at the bottom of the 'Home' page to create real-life swapping events.

    <img src="./static/graphics/readme/mockups/mockup-events.png" height="400px" />

## Database

### Structure
- Database 'swap_clothes' contain 4 collections
    - **Users** - The main function of this collections is to store user data which is retrieved to identify user, personalize user's experience by suggesting them items they are looking for, facilitate authorization, store their socials to be retrieved if they match with another user. The data is inserted from the 'Register' page and can be edited from the 'My Profile' page. Socials are used on item cards.

    <img src="./static/graphics/readme/col-users.png" height="150px" />

    - **Items** - The main function is to store data about each item which is visually then rendered in item cards. The secondary function is to be used in 'liking' and 'matching' functionality as well as searching and filtering. This data is inserted on the 'Add Item' page, which can be edited on the 'Edit Item' page, and displayed across the website in item cards. Used in back-end logic across all pages to display item footer icons depending if the user is logged in, creator of the account, or admin. 

    <img src="./static/graphics/readme/col-items.png" height="200px" />

    - **Matches** - Used mainly in matching logic to keep track of which users are the logged-in user liked by. This collection is mainly used alongside the 'items' collection to facilitate 'liking' and 'matching' functionality.

    <img src="./static/graphics/readme/col-matches.png" height="100px" />

    -  **Categories** - Used to keep all types of categories (such as item fit, item categories, profile image link
    s, etc.) as arrays that are mainly used in dropdowns and to display item category filter.

    <img src="./static/graphics/readme/col-categories.png" height="400px" />



### Relationship
- The relationship between different fields is shown in the image below. Even though the database used in this project was non-relation, I believe in the future this project could benefit from a SQL based relation database
